‚ùó Problem
When querying JSON files in S3 via Amazon Athena, you may encounter errors like:
"HIVE_CURSOR_ERROR: Row is not a valid JSON Object - JSONException: A JSONObject text must end with '}' ..."

üí• Root Cause
  Athena expects each line in the JSON file to be a valid, self-contained JSON object ‚Äî also known as JSON Lines (or .jsonl format). If your file is:
      A single large JSON object or array
      Pretty-printed/multi-line JSON
      Contains trailing commas or malformed syntax
          ‚Üí Athena cannot parse it and throws an error.

‚úÖ Solution
1)Use JSON Lines format:
    Ensure the file has one JSON object per line, not an array.
    Do not wrap the objects in [].
    Example (3 lines = 3 records):
            {"post_id":"1", "text":"Happy day", "sentiment":"POSITIVE"}
            {"post_id":"2", "text":"So sad", "sentiment":"NEGATIVE"}
            {"post_id":"3", "text":"Meh", "sentiment":"NEUTRAL"}

‚úçÔ∏è Summary 
Athena cannot parse standard JSON arrays. It requires JSON Lines format, where each line is a complete JSON object, without surrounding brackets ([]). You can convert your structured JSON using a Python script or online tools for compatibility.
